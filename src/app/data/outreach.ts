    text: "This outreach was made possible by Aidan Katz who used to be part of JHS 67 FLL team.  Many of their FLL members were not very familiar with FTC and a lot of 4785 and 3017 members were also not too familiar with this year's FLL challenge.  For this reason, both teams interacted and it was a learning experience for everyone.",

    text: "Representing the Engineering and Robotics programs, team members stayed late to talk to prospective students and their parents.  A lot of eighth graders we spoke to were equally thrilled and intrigued by the thought of building and programming a robot.  After the conversation that the team members had with the visiting middle school students, most of them expressed interest in joining a team.",

    text: "Working with York College Astrobotics team, the Francis robotics members helped in showcasing Astrobotics' swarm robots and their NASA sponsored rover to event spectators.  Many kids were captivated by the small robot so the team made sure that young children were fully engaged during the demo. FLHS robotics members also spoke about the programming and manufacturing that goes into creating robots.  It was as much of a learning experience for our students as it was for all the kids that they interacted during the course of the day.",

    text: "Just like in the previous years, Francis Lewis Robotics showed its support to NYC FIRST by helping to promote First Tech Challenge during this year's WSF.  Due inclement weather, the entire display was moved indoors to one of NYU's rooms.  Even though the weather was not cooperating, turnout was still high. Our team left exhausted but very accomplished after talking to hundreds of festival attendees.",
