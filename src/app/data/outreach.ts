      text:"This outreach was made possible by Aidan Katz who used to be part of JHS 67 FLL team.  Many of their FLL members were not very familiar with FTC and a lot of 4785 and 3017 members were also not too familiar with this year's FLL challenge.  For this reason, both teams interacted and it was a learning experience for everyone.",
